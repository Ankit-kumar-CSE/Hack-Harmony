            ####  Developed from scratch by me and my teammate. We utilized AI-driven tools (such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT) to assist with boilerplate code     
            ,     generation and debugging, ensuring a swift and efficient development process while maintaining full ownership of the core logic and design.
